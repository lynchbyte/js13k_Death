vr & ar standard three.js ar/vr buttons not used, instead this web xr explainer was helpful
https://github.com/immersive-web/webxr/blob/master/explainer.md


Bugs;
AR
*the board sometime jumps around after hit test,
*the double tap on mode and reticle hit occasionally overlap,
*once node highlighted it can't be unhightlighted to select another node,
*the ui board/stats don't follow a new board's location,
*the select doesn't always work when leaving Easy mode going to Extreme Mode.

VR
*floor plane, sometimes the alpha shader cuts out and the whole plane can be seen.

Not perfect, something to work on for next year.
